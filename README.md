### Hi there my name is Alvaro 👋

With a strong background in psychology and over six years of experience in the marketing industry, I am a detail-oriented and highly adaptable professional. My expertise in market research and business/data analytics, combined with my postgraduate specialization in Human Talent Management, a Master's Degree in Organizational Psychology, and Ph.D. in Consumer Behavior, has equipped me with a unique skill set in the field.

In addition to my academic achievements, I have also gained hands-on experience in project management, marketing management, and the use of programming languages for market data analysis, as well as developing strategic plans and utilizing predictive statistical modeling for business.
